## [2026-01-31 15:45] - GitHub Copilot Instructions Setup

### Prompt
"Generate custom copilot common instructions file for full project. It is a learning project for github copilot AI training course with .net backend part and react frontend part. The main goal is to achieve close to 90% of generated code using AI instead of manual coding. Add instruction to /.github folder"

### Context
- Initial project setup phase
- Empty project with only README.md
- Need to establish AI-first development guidelines
- Project goal: Achieve ~90% AI-generated code through effective prompting
- Tech stack: ASP.NET Core 9 backend + React 19+ TypeScript frontend
- Learning project for GitHub Copilot AI training course

### Files Added/Modified
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Created: Comprehensive AI-first development instructions
- `Docs/ai-workflow-log.md` - Created: This workflow log file for tracking development progress

### Generated Code Summary
- Complete copilot instructions covering:
  - AI-First Development Principles (maximize code generation, prompt engineering)
  - Technology stack specifications (Backend: ASP.NET Core 9, Frontend: React 19+)
  - Code generation patterns for backend endpoints, frontend features, and full-stack features
  - File templates for entities and components
  - Quick generation commands and expected AI behavior
  - Project structure guidelines
  - Domain definition (Volunteer Event Portal with core entities)
  - Quality standards, security, and testing guidelines
  - Development workflow logging instructions with standardized format
  - Tips for achieving 90% AI-generated code
  - Response format preferences

### Result
✅ Success
- Comprehensive instructions file created with all essential guidelines
- Standardized workflow logging format established
- Clear AI-first development principles defined
- Generation patterns documented for both backend and frontend
- Quick command patterns established for efficient prompting
- Workflow logging section with detailed structure and example

### AI Generation Percentage
Estimate: ~95% (AI generated the entire copilot-instructions.md file with minor guidance on structure)

### Learnings/Notes
- Clear, specific prompts about project goals produced excellent results
- AI understood the learning project context and optimized instructions for educational purposes
- Including the "90% AI-generated code" goal in prompt helped shape instruction tone
- Follow-up prompt to add workflow logging extended instructions seamlessly
- The standardized log format will help track AI generation effectiveness throughout the project
- This approach of documenting development workflow creates valuable learning trail for course participants
